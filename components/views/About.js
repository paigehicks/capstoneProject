<br>Im a 24 yr old mexican-guatemalan artist living in Georgia, US. I mainly work in digital art, but  I also paint and work in a variety of other mediums from time to time.
<br>My work is usually in a cartoon style, but I'm influenced by different styles all the time! My art style is inspired by interests in space, nature, creature design, and emotion.`;
